# Welcome to ICon Select!

Have you ever wanted to have an easy to use component that looks exactly (almost) like a select tag with the added benefit of showing images, videos, webGL, or live streaming contents instead of words? Have you wanted to transform a select tag into a more meaningful drop-down when it comes to have a list of images, videos, webGLs, live streaming items to pick from? Have you thought of adding animation on images or having slide operation on user favorite items? If so, then welcome to Icon Select!
